<b><p>Jerusalem It is the capital of the State of Israel and the Jerusalem District, and the largest city in Israel in terms of population size. As of 2021, it has a population of about 958,000.</b>
 Jerusalem is home to Israel's government institutions: the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the President's Residence, the Prime Minister's House and most government ministries.
      Jerusalem is located in the Judean Mountains, on the national watershed of the Land of Israel, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea, at an elevation of 570 to 857 meters above sea level.</p>

     <p>The city is sacred in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It was the center of the life of the Jewish people in ancient times, and the object of its longing and longing during its exile. Because of its religious importance for the three religions, the city has throughout history been a focus of wars and conflicts, which continue to this day. Since the end of the 19th century, neighborhoods of the new city have developed around the Old City, which house, as of the 21st century, the vast majority of its inhabitants.</p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">The Western Wall and the Old City</h3>
	<p>It is one of the four retaining walls that have surrounded the Temple Mount for about two thousand years, from the end of the Second Temple period to the present day. In the Jewish tradition, the Western Wall is considered extremely sacred, and probably as early as the 14th century, a place of worship next to it, which is used because of the day.
     The Western Wall is of religious importance due to the character of the Holy of Holies and the only remnant of the Temple, along with national and historical importance, and these bring to it millions of visitors each year, Jews and non-Jews. Bnei Mitzvah ascends to the Torah there on Mondays and Thursdays, soldiers swear allegiance to its upper plaza, and people from around the world visit it.</p>

		<p>The Gihon spring has been used for generations as the main water supply to Jerusalem, and it flows to this day on the slopes of the City of David south of the Old City.</p>
		<b><li><a style="color:brown"href="https://www.ybz.org.il/?CategoryID=981&ArticleID=4747#.Ya0bjNBBw2w" target="_">Lifta</li></a></b>
	    <p>Lifta Spring - one of the largest springs in the Jerusalem mountains. It is a 60 m long female spring. It feeds a collecting pool and its waters slide into an ancient pool and continue down the valley through the irrigation canals.
        Lifta orchards - the orchards stretch mainly at the foot of the spring. In this area you can see an abundance of figs, and also some plum trees are planted down the valley. Almond trees stand out on the slopes far from the valley.
        The village of Lifta - the village itself is not included in the reserve. The place was inhabited at various times in history until its conquest during the War of Independence. Today the picturesque buildings are maintained and some have certain pits, so they are forbidden to reach. However, it is possible to walk the path between some of the ancient buildings.</p>
       <b><li><a style="color:brown"href="https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/forests-and-parks/sataf-site.aspx" targer="_">Ein Steph</li></a></b>
       <p>Steph: An ancient village is just one of a number of ancient villages located on Mount Eitan. It is highly recommended to climb to the top of the mountain to observe the area. At the top of the mountain (788 meters above sea level) you will find another village called Khirbet a-Luz as well as full cisterns to which you can go down the ladders and even swim in them (for the brave only). For those who wake up, one can come and see the sunrise quickly. On their way up you are likely to meet people running in the circular route around Mount Eitan marked with red trails. The route is 8 km long and is popular with residents of Jerusalem and the surrounding area as a running track as well as a bicycle track.</p>
